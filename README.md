# Prog_Paralela-Lab02
Laboratory #02 - Parallel programming


# Description

This laboratory consists of a C++ program that generates N random numbers, stores them in a CSV file, sorts these numbers using the QuickSort algorithm, and finally saves the sorted numbers in a second CSV file.

The program makes use of dynamic memory to handle variable-sized arrays, allowing you to work with large data sets and adjust the size of the array based on the number of numbers specified by the user. This is essential to evaluate the efficiency and scalability of the sorting algorithm.

# Compile
```bash
g++ -o Exercise01 Exercise01.cpp
```

```bash
./Exercise01
```
